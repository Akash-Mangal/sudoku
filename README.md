The Basic Java Sudoku Solver is a console-based application that efficiently solves Sudoku puzzles using fundamental Java concepts such as arrays and polymorphism. Sudoku, a popular logic-based number placement puzzle, requires filling a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits without repetition.

**Algorithmic Approach:** The solver employs a systematic algorithmic approach to solve Sudoku puzzles step by step. It starts by analyzing the given puzzle and making logical deductions to fill in as many cells as possible.

**Data Representation:** The puzzle board is represented as a 2D array, where each cell is a member of a Cell class hierarchy that utilizes polymorphism. This allows for encapsulation of the cell's attributes and behaviors.

**Logical Strategies:** The solver employs basic Sudoku solving strategies, including elimination and constraint propagation. It iterates through the puzzle, checking rows, columns, and boxes to deduce potential values for each cell.

**Efficiency:** The solver is designed to minimize the number of necessary guesses by prioritizing cells with the fewest possibilities, which enhances its efficiency in solving a wide range of Sudoku puzzles.

**Educational Value:** The project serves as a valuable educational resource for learning about Java arrays, object-oriented programming, and polymorphism while demonstrating how algorithmic problem-solving techniques can be applied to real-world puzzles.

Overall, the Basic Java Sudoku Solver showcases how essential programming concepts in Java can be utilized to create an efficient solver for a well-known puzzle, providing an engaging platform for practicing logical reasoning and programming skills.
